# TOPMed Analysis Pipeline -- WDL Version

![help wanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/help-wanted-red)**WIP; not suitable for published use**![help wanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/help-wanted-red)

[![WDL 1.0 shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/WDL-1.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/main/versions/1.0/SPEC.md)  
This is a collection of several WDL files which attempt to implement some components of the [University of Washington TOPMed pipeline](https://github.com/UW-GAC/analysis_pipeline). Rather than running as a Python pipeline, this takes the R scripts which the Python pipeline is calling and wraps them into various WDL tasks. The original goal of this task was to provide sample preparation options for TOPMed Freeze 8 users on Terra, who previously had to work with an unoptimized Jupyter notebook, but it may have wider applications than that. Still, to that end, it is **not complete** and it should not be used for publications at this point in time.

As it works in a Docker container, it does not have any external dependencies other than the usual setup required for [WDL](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/documentation/quickstart) and [Cromwell](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/).

## Bonuses
* The original script required a space to be included in input files. This is no longer necessary as the conversion from vcf to gds will add a space into the file name.

## Limitations
* At the moment, everything exists in one WDL file. The eventual plan is to break this down into multiple WDLs while still providing one mega-WDL, if it proves feasible to maintain both options.
* Functionality is not one-to-one with the UW pipeline.
* Currently this pipeline does not use [bcftools](http://www.htslib.org/download/) and therefore cannot handle bcf files.
* This pipeline expects every VCF file placed inside of it to represent one chromosome's variants only. Multi-chromosome VCFs are currently not officially supported.

### Authors
Contributing authors to the WDLs in this fork include:
* Ash O'Farrell (aofarrel@ucsc.edu)
* Tim Majarian (tmajaria@broadinstitute.org) -- original [GDS2VCF WDL](https://github.com/manning-lab/vcfToGds) that this project was originally a fork of

## General notes
Nearly all scripts require a GDS file in SeqArray format. Phenotype files should be an AnnotatedDataFrame saved in an RData file. See `?AnnotatedDataFrame` or the SeqVarTools documentation for details. Example files are provided in `testdata`.

The original verison of this pipeline allowed for running on a per-chromosome basis. At the moment this is not officially implemented, as it is expected people will be using this for a GWAS and therefore tossing a bunch of single-chromosome VCFs at it rather than trying to list out every single one.

The original script had arguments relating to runtime such as `ncores` and `cluster_type` that do not apply to WDL. Please familarize yourself with the [runtime attributes of WDL](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/RuntimeAttributes/) if you are unsure how your settings may transfer.

# Workflow Overview
All workflow inputs go into one JSON file. With that being said, because this is a big pipeline, this README breaks them down in catagory per R script they apply to.

## Conversion to GDS
This script converts VCF (one per chromosome) to GDS files, discarding non-genotype FORMAT fields.  
...and that's it.  
Currently, it only runs vcfToGds.R, meaning that ensuring unique variant IDs (unique_variant_ids.R) and genotypic consistency (check_gds.R) are skipped. However, implenting these scripts are being worked on.

### Required Inputs
* vcf : an *array of vcf files* in vcf, .vcf.bgz, or .vcf.gz format
* vcfgds_disk : *int* of disk space to allot for vcfToGds.R
* vcfgds_memory : *int* of memory to allot for vcfToGds.R

### Outputs
GDS file matching the name of the input vds with ".gds" appeneded to the end.

## LD Prune
This stage automatically takes in the GDS output of the previous step.
1. ld_pruning.R, based on [UoW ld_pruning.R](https://github.com/UW-GAC/analysis_pipeline/blob/master/R/ld_pruning.R)
2. The subset_gds.R, based on [UoW subset_gds.R](https://github.com/UW-GAC/analysis_pipeline/blob/master/R/subset_gds.R)

### Required Inputs
* ldprune_disk : *int* of disk space to allot for ld_pruning.R
* ldprune_memory : *int* of memory to allot for ld_pruning.R

### Optional Inputs
    parameter | type | default value | description
    --------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------
	`autosome_only`     | bool | `FALSE` | Only include autosomes in LD pruning.
	`exclude_pca_corr`  | bool | `TRUE`  | Exclude variants in regions with high correlation with PCs (HLA, LCT, inversions).
	`genome_build`.     | str  | `hg38` | Genome build, used to define correlation regions.
	`ld_r_threshold`    | float| `0.32`  | `r` threshold for LD pruning. Default is `r^2 = 0.1`.
	`ld_win_size`       | int  | `10`    | Sliding window size in Mb for LD pruning.
	`maf_threshold`     | float| `0.01`  | Minimum MAF for variants used in LD pruning.
	`missing_threshold` | int  | `0.01`  | Maximum missing call rate for variants.

Be aware that the default for autosome_only is the **opposite** of the default of [the pipeline this is based on](https://github.com/UW-GAC/analysis_pipeline), as it expected users will be inputing one VCF per chr, therefore if they wanted to exclude not-autosomes then they'd have excluded them from the inputs.

### Outputs
A Rdata file of the pruned variants and subsetted GDS files.
